What happens when you initialize a repositor? Why do you need to do it?

When you use the command git init, you create a git respository of a
directory. You can use the command git status to track the git status of
a directory. No commits are listed when a repository is created, as you
are responsible for creating commits yourself. You should do this when
you want to track the history of your files. For example, these
reflections
are now being tracked in a git repository as a way of learning.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where your files go when you run the command git
add; it is the in-between area of a directory and a commit. You don't
need to put all of the files in your working directory (e.g. reflections)
into the staging area, but all of the files in the staging area come
from your working directory.
