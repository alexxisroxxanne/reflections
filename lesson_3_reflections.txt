When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

Using a remote repository would be very useful in situations where you
may be using multiple computers or where there are several people working
on the same project. This way, everyone/all computers may access the most
up to date version of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Considering the fact that multiple people may be working on one project,
it makes sense that remote repositories use a manual update rather
than an automatic one - perhaps you need to collaborate with your partner
before accepting their changes.
